Output: 

3, 6, 7


**11.** Write a program that will take integer numbers as user input continuously and print the sum of numbers until user input q from the keyboard. When user input q, the program will be quit. If the user inputs another character, then the program will ask to input the number again.

**12.** A core i 7 laptop price is 85000 tk and a gaming mouse price is 2500 tk. If I buy the laptop and 1 piece mouse, what will be my total cost after giving 15% discount? [Extract the digits from the paragraph and calculate the price]
